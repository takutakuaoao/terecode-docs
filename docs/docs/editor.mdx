## Code Block

You could include several **Code Blocks** in post content as follows.

````
```
something code ...
```
````

### Syntax Highlighting

You could also use the feature of **syntax highlighting** by adding an extension name with the code block.

For example, if you want to write TypeScript code with syntax highlighting, you could write it by adding the `ts` extension as follows.

````
```ts
typescript code ...
```
````

At the moment, the available languages and extension names to use syntax highlighting are the list below.

| Language | Extension name |
| :---: | :---: |
| Typescript | ts |
| Javascript | js |
| PHP | php |
| Golang | go |

## Preview

If you want to confirm how it will appear on the timeline before you submit a post content, you can use preview screen as follows.

import Preview from '/img/preview.gif';

<img src={Preview} alt="Preview" style={{width: "100%"}} />
